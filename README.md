# metricDP

This repository provides a structured survey of **Metric Differential Privacy (mDP)** research, categorizing papers based on key aspects such as **problem domain, context, distance metric, mechanism type, discrete vs. continuous setting, application, scalability, and utility**. The repository consists of three main files:  

1. **Paper Summaries**: A comprehensive analysis of mDP-related papers, focusing on their core contributions and technical aspects. Each paper is examined through the lens of:  
   - **Domain & Context**: The specific privacy problem being addressed.  
   - **Distance Metric**: How distances between data points are defined to enforce privacy.  
   - **Mechanism**: The differential privacy mechanism used (e.g., Laplace, Exponential, Utility-Optimal).  
   - **Discrete vs. Continuous**: Whether the method operates in a discrete or continuous setting.  
   - **Application**: Practical use cases where the mechanism is applied.  
   - **Scalability & Utility**: Evaluation of computational feasibility and privacy-utility trade-offs.  

2. **Attack Models**: A collection of research discussing different **attack strategies** against mDP mechanisms, analyzing their effectiveness, assumptions, and potential defenses.  

3. **Evolution & Inheritance**: A roadmap of how mDP research has evolved, showing relationships between papers, key advancements, and how different works build upon each other.  

This repository serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners exploring **mDP** and its applications, offering structured insights into the field's development.
