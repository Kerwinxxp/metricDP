# metricDP

This repository contains a collection of summarized research papers related to Metric Differential Privacy (mDP). The focus is on three key mechanisms:

Laplace Mechanism: Its applications in mDP, particularly in location privacy protection and extensions for continuous and multiple location reports.
Exponential Mechanism: How it is adapted for mDP and its role in utility-preserving privacy-preserving mechanisms.
Utility-Optimal Mechanisms: Methods based on linear programming to achieve optimal trade-offs between privacy and utility in mDP.
This repository serves as a reference for researchers interested in mDP, providing concise paper summaries to facilitate understanding of key contributions in this field.
