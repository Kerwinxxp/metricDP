# metricDP

This repository provides a structured survey of **Metric Differential Privacy (mDP)** research, categorizing papers based on key aspects such as **problem domain, context awareness, distance metric, mechanism type, discrete vs. continuous setting, application, scalability, and utility**. The repository consists of three main files:  

#metricDP_related_work.md
1. **MetricDP Related Works**: A comprehensive analysis of mDP-related papers, focusing on their core contributions and technical aspects. Each paper is examined through the lens of:  
   - **Domain**: The specific area of application (e.g., location privacy, crowdsourcing, federated learning).  
   - **Context Awareness**: Whether the proposed method is **context-free** or **context-aware**.  
   - **Distance Metric**: The metric used to measure distances in mDP (e.g., Euclidean, Wasserstein).  
   - **Mechanism**: The differential privacy mechanism used (e.g., Laplace, Exponential, Utility-Optimal).  
   - **Discrete vs. Continuous**: Whether the method operates in a discrete or continuous setting.  
   - **Application**: The real-world use cases of the proposed approach.  
   - **Scalability & Utility**: The feasibility of the approach in large-scale settings and its privacy-utility trade-offs.
